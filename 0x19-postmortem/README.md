# Issue Summary:
## Duration: 
August 10, 2023, 14:00 - August 10, 2023, 16:30 (GMT+3)
## Impact:
Slow response times and intermittent outages for our e-commerce platform. Users experienced delays and errors during the outage, affecting approximately 20% of users.

# Timeline:
- 14:00: The issue was detected through monitoring alerts indicating increased response times.
- 14:10: Engineering team initiated investigation upon alert receipt.
- 14:20: Initial assumption was an application-level bottleneck due to recent code deployment.
- 14:45: Investigation revealed no significant changes in application code, shifting focus to underlying infrastructure.
- 15:00: Misleading path: Suspected database overload; optimization attempts proved fruitless.
- 15:30: Issue escalated to database and networking teams as complexity increased.
- 15:45: Collaborative analysis identified abnormal network traffic patterns.
- 16:00: Root cause identified as a DDoS attack targeting the network infrastructure.
- 16:15: Traffic filtering and load balancing measures were implemented to mitigate the attack.
- 16:30: Response times returned to normal as attack traffic subsided.
Root Cause and Resolution:
The issue was caused by a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack targeting our network infrastructure. The attack flooded our servers with a high volume of requests, leading to increased response times and intermittent outages. To resolve the issue, we implemented traffic filtering and load balancing mechanisms that identified and filtered out malicious traffic. This helped restore normal response times and mitigate the impact of the attack.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent similar incidents in the future, we will:

- Enhance DDoS protection: Implement robust DDoS mitigation strategies to automatically detect and mitigate attacks.
- Network monitoring: Strengthen network monitoring capabilities to detect unusual traffic patterns and respond proactively.
- Incident response training: Train teams to identify and respond effectively to DDoS attacks to minimize downtime.
- Scalability improvements: Investigate options for scaling infrastructure during sudden traffic spikes to maintain service quality.
- Regular drills: Conduct regular drills simulating DDoS attacks to ensure rapid and effective response.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Implement DDoS protection tools and integrate them into our infrastructure.
